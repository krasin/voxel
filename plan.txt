Minimum Viable Product for 3d print optimizer.

1. A simple website (AppEngine) that allows to upload a mesh, stores it in the blob, adds a task for worker. Worker will download the blob and upload the result.

2. Worker

- gets the task from the frontend
- downloads the blob
- converts to .schematic voxel file
- runs optimizer (.npts)
- runs PoissonSurface reconstruction (.ply is the output format)
- converts .ply to .stl
- uploads the blob and reports the success


Stage 0: be able to optimize "by hand".
Pipeline:

1. binvox
2. optimize
3. PoissonRecon
4. meshlab

Missing piece: optimize.

Optimize plan:

1. Parse .schematic file (done)
2. Write .npts
3. Remove deep voxels
4. Make a hole
