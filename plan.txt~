Minimum Viable Product for 3d print optimizer.

1. A simple website (AppEngine) that allows to upload a mesh, stores it in the blob, adds a task for worker. Worker will download the blob and upload the result.

2. Worker

- gets the task from the frontend
- downloads the blob
- converts to .schematic voxel file
- runs optimizer
- runs PoissonSurface reconstruction (.ply is the output format)
- converts .ply to .stl
- uploads the blob and reports the success
